# Climbing Weather App

This is a web app for aggregating weather predictions at climbing areas. It is written in Python, using Flask and Sqlite and collects data from the [NOAA](www.noaa.gov), [Weather Underground](www.wunderground.com), and [Dark Sky](www.darksky.net). The current locations available are [the Gunks](https://www.mountainproject.com/v/the-gunks/105798167), [Rumney](https://www.mountainproject.com/v/rumney/105867829), [Joshua Tree](https://www.mountainproject.com/v/joshua-tree-national-park/105720495), and [the Red River Gorge](https://www.mountainproject.com/v/red-river-gorge/105841134).

Here is a [screen shot](app_screenshot.png) of the app where you can see the average predicted chance of rain and high temperature (as well as the deviations for each of those metrics).

## Using/Contributing

The app is (usually) available on my EC2 instance [here](ec2-184-72-99-116.compute-1.amazonaws.com). Please let me know if you would like any additional locations added. I have also been recording all the data, so if you'd like to use it for something just shoot me an email.
